Example plugin
===

This is an example plugin for using InjectorKit with BetterDiscord v2. As this version of BetterDiscord hasn't been released yet the plugin format is subject to change.

To use it (as of last change) copy this directory to the tests/plugins directory in the BetterDiscord source directory and change the require statement to resolve correctly.
